## Minutes
- Profiling
  - We set up a Salt dev environment (pip -e .)
    - We discussed the instructions on https://github.com/markuskramerIgitt/LearnSalt/tree/master/cProfile_performance_profiler
  - We profiled the 3000.2 minion with `salt-call --local file.replace` and discussed known and unknown wastes of time:
    - We installed snakeviz ("snake vizualizer"):
      - Snakeviz has an upper, **image section** that you can drill down and drill out (Reset Zoom)
      - Snakeviz has an lower, **table section** that you can sort
    - From the **image section**:
      - `file.replace` takes 12 seconds
      - `esxi.py` takes 7 / 12 seconds and is not needed on Windows. It is no longer loaded on Windows in [3001.1 through PR #57743](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/57743).
      - `loader.py` takes 8 / 12 seconds and loads grains, modules, dunders (`__salt__`) and probably other things, that individually detect the platform or compute other things. Because the platform is known, the individual detection is an unnecessary compation.  Avoiding these (or other) unnecessary compations could speed up `loader.py`.
      - `esxi.py` has (probably) been called by `loader.py`, which could make [PR #57743](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/57743) a blueprint for removing similar  wastes of time in `loader.py`.
    - From the **table section**, sorted by `cumtime`:
      - `frozen importlib._bootstrap` is called ~5,000 times and takes 10 / 12 seconds. This probably leads back to the loader.
   - We discussed that snakeviz delivers a useful overview but we lack experience to read and interpret the result.

## Outlook
We will continue to interpret the profile.

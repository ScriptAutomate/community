# Notes from 2020-09-15

## Attendees
- Shane Lee
- Dafydd (dafyddj)
- Joe Eacott

## Agenda
- Welcome
- Profiling
    - Following instructions on:
    - https://github.com/markuskramerIgitt/LearnSalt/tree/master/cProfile_performance_profiler
    - Setup a new Salt dev environment
    - Install snakeviz
    - Use Markus' repo 
    - Slowness issues seem to be addressed in master branch
- Dafyddj: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-winrepo-ng/pull/171
    - merged, we now have pre-commit
- Setting up a schedule for full branch test runs
    - Weekly
    - Using Github Actions
    - Mostly done
- An actual install test when Packages Definition file is changed (just for that one file)
- Automating the release process for salt-winrepo-ng
    - Used in the Formulas Working Group
    - Use https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release
    - Commit messages would need to be formatted properly
    - Triggered by merge into master branch
- A code jam to fix all the broken Package Definition Files (urls, yaml)
- Migrate test.py to Python 3
- Possibility of Running Salt Minion as Standard User
    - Have multiple minions running on the same machine
    - On for the System... one for handling/configuring a user account
    - User minion would only be able to manage those things that the user has
      access to (registry, files, software)
    - Need to write a SEP for this
        - /usr/local/bin => C:\Program Files\salt
        - /etc/salt => C:\ProgramData\salt
        - /srv/salt => 

## Action Items
- Let's profile some things and figure out why Salt is so much slower on Windows
- Dafydd: Bring the scheduled tests into master
- Dafydd: Automate semantic release (from salt-formulas)
- Dafydd: Investigate the installation tests (stretch)
- Shane/Joe: Start fixing broken Package Definition files
- Shane: Transition .travis/tests.py to Python 3 (Python3.6 default on Travis)
- Shane: Write a SEP for Install Salt Anywhere and address the possibility of
         having multiple instances of salt-minion on the same machine

## Next Release (Magnesium)
- Fix the Unicode Issue on Windows
- Minion Profiling (cross platform)
    - Where's the slowness, what's really going on
- Multiprocessing vs Threading
- Tiamat Build

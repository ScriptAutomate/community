# Notes from 2020-11-17

## Attendees
- Shane Lee
- Markus

## Agenda
- Welcome

## Multiprocessing Off
- Turning multiprocessing off worked very well for Markus
- Need to keep an eye on the jobs and any other irregularities

## Timeout issue
- Encountered a ``timeout`` issue in 3001
- Includes the Unicode fixes
- The minion service is running, but it cannot reach the master
- Set ping_interval to 2
- Stop the master
- There will be a stacktrace in the log
- https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/58942
- Needs some more investigation, could not replicate

## Action Items
- Markus will update the MSI so that it creates the minion service using SSM
- Compare Linux vs Windows performance on `test.version` using snakeviz
- Dafydd: Automate semantic release (from salt-formulas)
- Dafydd: Investigate the installation tests (stretch)
- Shane/Joe: Start fixing broken Package Definition files
- Shane: Write a SEP for Install Salt Anywhere and address the possibility of
         having multiple instances of salt-minion on the same machine

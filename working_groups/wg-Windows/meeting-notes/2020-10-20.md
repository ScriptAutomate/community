    - grain_funcs (https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/loader.py#L828)
```
    funcs = grain_funcs(opts, proxy=proxy, context=context or {})
    if force_refresh:  # if we refresh, lets reload grain modules
        funcs.clear()
    # Run core grains
    for key in funcs:  #<---- This line is really slow
```
notes from the LazyLoader
```
    .. note::
        Iterating over keys will cause all modules to be loaded.
